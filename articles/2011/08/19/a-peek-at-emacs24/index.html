<div class="entry-content"><h2>Prelude</h2>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve decided to have a look at the current development
version of Emacs &ndash; namely Emacs 24. I was quite impressed with the work done
by the development team so far so I decided to share some of the cool things
I&rsquo;ve found in Emacs 24.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this will be the most important Emacs release in
quite some time.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Installation changes in Emacs 24</h2>

<p>There are a couple of new build flags support in Emacs 24 &ndash; most
notably there is GTK 3.0 support present. You can enable it by passing
the <strong>&mdash;with-x-toolkit=gtk3</strong> flag to <em>configure</em>. There is also built-in
support for selinux (that can be disabled at build time) and the
installed info and man pages are now compressed by default.</p>

<p>All in all &ndash; nothing major has changed with the installation process.</p>

<p><img src="/images/articles/emacs24.png"></p>

<h2>General changes</h2>

<h4>Completion improvements</h4>

<p>There has been a lot of work done in the completion department. For
instance <strong>shell-mode</strong> now uses pcomplete rules and the standard
completion UI, which is pretty cool IMHO. Some other insteresting
improvements (mostly copied directly from Emacs&#8217; NEWS files):</p>

<ul>
<li>Many packages have been changed to use <em>completion-at-point</em> rather than
their own completion code.</li>
<li>Completion in a non-minibuffer now tries to detect the end of completion
and pops down the *Completions* buffer accordingly.</li>
<li>Completion can cycle, depending on completion-cycle-threshold.</li>
<li>There is a new completion style called <em>substring</em>.</li>
<li>Completion style can be set per-category with <em>completion-category-overrides</em>.</li>
<li>Completion of buffers now uses substring completion by default.</li>
<li><em>completing-read</em> can be customized using the new variable
<em>completing-read-function</em>.</li>
<li><em>minibuffer-local-filename-must-match-map</em> is not used any more.
Instead, the bindings in <em>minibuffer-local-filename-completion-map</em> are combined
with minibuffer-local-must-match-map.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Scrolling improvements</h4>

<p>Scrolling has always been a sour subject in Emacs. Emacs 24 finally
alleviates many of the long standing issues in the scrolling department:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>New scrolling commands <em>scroll-up-command</em> and <em>scroll-down-command</em>
(bound to C-v/[next] and M-v/[prior]) do not signal errors at top/bottom
of buffer at first key-press (instead move to top/bottom of buffer)
when a new variable <em>scroll-error-top-bottom</em> is non-nil.</p></li>
<li><p>New scrolling commands <em>scroll-up-line</em> and <em>scroll-down-line</em>
scroll a line instead of full screen.</p></li>
<li><p>New property <em>scroll-command</em> should be set on a command&rsquo;s symbol to
define it as a scroll command affected by <em>scroll-preserve-screen-position</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you customize <em>scroll-conservatively</em> to a value greater than 100,
Emacs will never recenter point in the window when it scrolls due to
cursor motion commands or commands that move point (e.f., <em>M-g M-g</em>).
Previously, you needed to use <em>most-positive-fixnum</em> as the value of
<em>scroll-conservatively</em> to achieve the same effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aggressive</strong> scrolling now honors the scroll margins.
If you customize <em>scroll-up-aggressively</em> or
<em>scroll-down-aggressively</em> and move point off the window, Emacs now
scrolls the window so as to avoid positioning point inside the scroll
margin.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>GTK improvements</h4>

<p>Linux users are in for a treat:</p>

<ul>
<li>GTK scroll bars are finally placed on the right by default.
You can still use <em>set-scroll-bar-mode</em> to change this.</li>
<li>GTK tool bars can have just text, just images or images and text.
Customize <em>tool-bar-style</em> to choose style.  On a Gnome desktop, the default
is taken from the desktop settings.</li>
<li>GTK tool bars can be placed on the left/right or top/bottom of the frame.
The frame-parameter tool-bar-position controls this.  It takes the values
top, left, right or bottom.  The <strong>Options => Show/Hide</strong> menu has entries
for this.</li>
<li>The colors for selected text (the region face) are taken from the GTK
theme when Emacs is built with GTK.</li>
<li>Emacs uses GTK tooltips by default if built with GTK.  You can turn that
off by customizing x-gtk-use-system-tooltips.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Cocoa (OS X improvements)</h4>

<p>OS X users seem to be a bit neglected, but still:</p>

<ul>
<li>the annoying bug with the cursor not having an inverse video face
(meaning you couldn&rsquo;t see the symbol under it) is finally fixed</li>
<li>the menu bar can be hidden by customizing
ns-auto-hide-menu-bar.</li>
</ul>


<h4>ELPA (a package manager for Emacs)</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>An Emacs Lisp package manager (aka ELPA) is now included.
This is a convenient way to download and install additional packages,
from a package repository at elpa.gnu.org.</p></li>
<li><p>The addition of external repositories is also supported ( I&rsquo;m
particularly fond of the <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/">Marmalade repo</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><em>M-x list-packages</em> shows a list of packages, which can be
selected for installation.</p></li>
<li><p>New command <em>describe-package</em>, bound to <em>C-h P</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>By default, all installed packages are loaded and activated
automatically when Emacs starts up.  To disable this, set
<em>package-enable-at-startup</em> to nil.  To change which packages are
loaded, customize <em>package-load-list</em>.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m personally a little bit underwhelmed by ELPA at this point. It
lacks something that I deem rather critical &ndash; the ability to upgrade
already installed packages automatically. Hopefully, this deficiency
will be amended in the near future.</p>

<p>There is also the restrictive licensing policy that GNU enforces
that will certainly prevent a lot of packages from being distributed
via the official ELPA repo.</p>

<h4>Custom color themes</h4>

<p>Most hackers are very fond of custom color themes. I&rsquo;m no exception &ndash;
after all I&rsquo;m the maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs">Zenburn color theme for Emacs</a>. The
problems with custom color themes so far was that depended on the
horrible external package color-theme, that wasn&rsquo;t maintained
particularly actively in the past few years.</p>

<p>Now Emacs 24 comes with a built-in theming infrastructure
affectionately called <strong>deftheme</strong> and several quite nice themes that
Emacs users can choose from (like tango). I&rsquo;ve already ported Zenburn to the
deftheme infrastructure, so if you like it be sure to give it a
try. The magic command you&rsquo;ll need to keep in mind is called <em>load-theme</em>.</p>

<h2>Editing improvements</h2>

<p>Emacs is after all mostly an editor and there is a lot of work done in
the editing area in 24:</p>

<h4>Search changes</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>C-y in Isearch is now bound to isearch-yank-kill, instead of
isearch-yank-line.</p></li>
<li><p>M-y in Isearch is now bound to isearch-yank-pop, instead of
isearch-yank-kill.</p></li>
<li><p>M-s C-e in Isearch is now bound to isearch-yank-line.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>There is a new command <em>count-words-region</em>, which does what you expect.</p></li>
<li><p><em>completion-at-point</em> now handles tags and semantic completion.</p></li>
<li><p>The default value of <em>backup-by-copying-when-mismatch</em> is now t.</p></li>
<li><p>The command <em>just-one-space</em> (C-SPC), if given a negative argument,
also deletes newlines around point.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Deletion changes</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>New option <em>delete-active-region</em>.
If non-nil, C-d, [delete], and DEL delete the region if it is active
and no prefix argument is given.  If set to <em>kill</em>, these commands
kill instead.</p></li>
<li><p>New command <em>delete-forward-char</em>, bound to C-d and [delete].
This is meant for interactive use, and obeys <em>delete-active-region</em>.
The command <em>delete-char</em> does not obey <em>delete-active-region</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>delete-backward-char</em> is now a Lisp function.
Apart from obeying <em>delete-active-region</em>, its behavior is unchanged.
However, the byte compiler now warns if it is called from Lisp; you
should use delete-char with a negative argument instead.</p></li>
<li><p>The option <em>mouse-region-delete-keys</em> has been deleted.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Selection changes</h4>

<p>The default handling of clipboard and primary selections was changed
to conform with modern X applications.  In short, most commands for
killing and yanking text now use the clipboard, while mouse commands
use the primary selection.</p>

<p>In the following, we provide a list of these changes, followed by a
list of steps to get the old behavior back if you prefer that.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>select-active-regions</em> now defaults to t.
Merely selecting text (e.g. with drag-mouse-1) no longer puts it in
the kill ring.  The selected text is put in the primary selection, if
the system possesses a separate primary selection facility (e.g. X).</p></li>
<li><p><em>select-active-regions</em> also accepts a new value, <em>only</em>.
This means to only set the primary selection for temporarily active
regions (usually made by mouse-dragging or shift-selection);
&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; active regions, such as those made with C-SPC followed by
point motion, do not alter the primary selection.</p></li>
<li><p><em>mouse-drag-copy-region</em> now defaults to nil.</p></li>
<li><p>mouse-2 is now bound to <em>mouse-yank-primary</em>.
This pastes from the primary selection, ignoring the kill-ring.
Previously, mouse-2 was bound to <em>mouse-yank-at-click</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>x-select-enable-clipboard</em> now defaults to t on all platforms.</p></li>
<li><p><em>x-select-enable-primary</em> now defaults to nil.
Thus, commands that kill text or copy it to the kill-ring (such as
M-w, C-w, and C-k) also use the clipboard&mdash;-not the primary selection.</p></li>
<li><p>The &ldquo;Copy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cut&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; items in the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; menu are now
exactly equivalent to, respectively M-w, C-w, and C-y.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that on MS-Windows, <em>x-select-enable-clipboard</em> was already
non-nil by default, as Windows does not support the primary selection
between applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for X cut buffers has been removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for X clipboard managers has been added.</p></li>
<li><p>To inhibit use of the clipboard manager, set
<em>x-select-enable-clipboard-manager</em> to nil.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>New modes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Occur Edit mode applies edits made in *Occur* buffers to the
original buffers.  It is bound to C-x C-q in Occur mode. This
basically removes the need for an external package such as iedit.el.</p></li>
<li><p>New global minor modes electric-pair-mode, electric-indent-mode,
and electric-layout-mode. One of my favourite new
additions. electric-pair-mode renders obsolete the popular
autopair-mode and electric-indent-mode and electric-layout-mode
provide a much more IDE feel to the editing experience in Emacs. This
triumvirate of modes has been a long time coming</p></li>
<li><p>secrets.el is an implementation of the Secret Service API, an
interface to password managers like GNOME Keyring or KDE Wallet.  The
Secret Service API requires D-Bus for communication.  The command
<em>secrets-show-secrets</em> offers a buffer with a visualization of the
secrets.</p></li>
<li><p>notifications.el provides an implementation of the Desktop
Notifications API.  It requires D-Bus for communication.</p></li>
<li><p>soap-client.el supports access to SOAP web services from Emacs.
soap-inspect.el is an interactive inspector for SOAP WSDL structures.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>Emacs 24 brings quite a lot to the table. I&rsquo;ve barely scratch the
surface as far as the new features are concerned. There is so much
more &ndash; improvements to lots of the existing modes (most notably much
better support for distributed VC systems such as Git, Mercurial and
Bazaar), internal cleanups and improvements, etc.</p>

<p>I truly feel that Emacs 24 will be the most important Emacs release in
a long long time and I commend the new dev team leads for their
passion and resolve to modernize Emacs.</p>

<p>Expect future blog posts dedicated to specific new features and
improvements.</p>

<p>P.S. Btw <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">The Emacs Prelude</a>
already makes use of some the new features from Emacs 24. In due time
it will make use of much more of them. It&rsquo;s one of the very few
advanced Emacs setups targeting exclusively Emacs 24.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>A lot of people have been asking me about the level of stability and
usability of Emacs 24 at this point since I didn&rsquo;t mention them at my
article. I&rsquo;ve been using Emacs 24 for all of my work for about a month
now and I&rsquo;ve experienced absolutely no crashes/freezes/any sort of
instabilities. On the usability side I&rsquo;ve encountered a few bugs that
might be related to some work in progress (for instance face inheritance doesn&rsquo;t
work with deftheme), but nothing major.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re considering trying out Emacs 24 more seriously &ndash; my advice
is to go for it. With no clear release date in sight you might be in
for a long wait before the final release is here and you&rsquo;ll be missing
on some really great features in the meantime. I&rsquo;ll write a separate
article soon detailing how to get started with Emacs 24 on the most
popular platforms (Linux, OS X and Windows).</p>
