While I doubt that any of you want to read something about me I'll
continue writing anyway.

My name is Bozhidar Ivanov Batsov. I'm originally from Veliko Tarnovo,
Bulgaria, but I've been residing in Sofia (Bulgaria's current capitol)
for quite some time now.

I'm currently the CTO of [Tradeo Inc.](http://tradeo.com), where I
develop and supervise various Ruby on Rails and Node.js applications. Before that
I've worked as Java developer (Swing, JavaEE, etc). Before that I used
to be a C++ developer and before that I developed Linux kernel drivers
for some embedded devices. As you can see I've gradually transferred
from low-level to very high level programming - hopefully this will
preserve my sanity for a while.

For more professional details - check my [linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bozhidarbatsov).

Apart from programming I've always been fond of Unix operating systems
(and operating systems in general (especially those with the source
code lying around)). My favorite editor is Emacs, my shell of choice
is zsh and my preferred VCS is git. I'm quite proficient in Linux and
I happen to be an LPIC-2 certified system administrator.

I maintain a couple of smallish open-source projects here and there
(mostly on [GitHub](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)) and I've contributed to many more. I'm also the
principle author of the [community-driven Ruby coding style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)
and the
[community-driven Ruby on Rails style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide).

Some of my other projects in no particular order:

* [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) - A static code analyzer for Ruby
* [Powerpack](https://github.com/bbatsov/powerpack) - A few useful extensions to core Ruby classes
* [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) - An Emacs distribution built on top of GNU Emacs 24
* [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) - Project Interaction Library for Emacs, that stays out of your way

I teach some free programming courses from time to time, covering
topics like Perl, Java and Ruby. I've also taught a few Linux
courses. From time to time I happen to speak at various technical
conferences.

I've created this blog so that I could share some of my thoughts
(mostly technical) with other people that might be interested in
them. I don't blog very often and I'm no master writer, but I do hope
you'll enjoy some of the articles here.
