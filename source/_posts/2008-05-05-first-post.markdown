{% blockquote Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Trailer %}
Every Generation Has A Legend. Every Journey Has A First Step. Every
Saga Has A Beginning.
{% endblockquote %}

Hello, everyone! Welcome to my blog!

I'll post here bits and pieces inspired by my humble experience as a
software developer. Expect to see primarily articles about Lisp,
Emacs, Java and Ruby, but also about software development in general.

As a fan of the Star Wars franchise I often like to quote characters
from the movies. I feel that this is the time for one such quote.

{% blockquote Master Yoda, The Phantom Menace %}
Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an
apprentice.
{% endblockquote %}

I’m no hacker wizard by any means, but I hope that I can
help someone learn something useful and maybe I'll manage to learn something
from the readers of my blog(if I have any, that is). In this sense
one can say that in life we're always the master and the apprentice at
the same time...

I hope you'll enjoy reading my blog!
