After I launched the
[Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) I
often received requests to create a tool enforcing the rules in the guide
automatically.

Today this tool is a reality - meet
[RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop). RuboCop already covers
a significant portion of the Guide, supports both MRI 1.9 and MRI 2.0
and has pretty neat Emacs integration(via
[rubocop.el](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop-emacs) and
[flycheck](https://github.com/lunaryorn/flycheck)).

I'd love to see more Ruby hackers check out RuboCop!

I'd love to thank all the great people who contributed code, issue
reports and ideas to RuboCop's development and I sincerely hope many
Ruby hackers will find it useful!
