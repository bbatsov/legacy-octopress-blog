Have you ever been wondering how to access the Emacs menu bar, when
using Emacs in console mode? The answer is easy - press **F10** or type
**M-x menu-bar-open**(both methods work in X as well, of course).

Although the menu bar is rarely used by seasoned Emacs veterans,
exploring it is a great way to get started with the capabilities of
the new modes, so being able to access it is generally a good thing.
