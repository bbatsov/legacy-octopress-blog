I'm happy to report that now you can use permalinks to the rules listed in the
community [Clojure style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide) as well.

Here's an
[example](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#when-instead-of-single-branch-if).
Now you can easily refer to rules in heated style debates with your
friends and co-workers. :-)

This is an addition that was way overdue (for which I take all the
blame). I'd like to say a big `THANKS!!!` to [rbf](https://github.com/rbf) who
found the time I never did and got the job done (in style).
