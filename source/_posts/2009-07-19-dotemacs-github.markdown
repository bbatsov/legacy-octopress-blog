When you have applications, whose configuration is as complex as that
of Emacs it’s always a good idea to store that configuration under
version control so you can easily share it between multiple
computers. You can always set up some version control system yourself,
but it’s a lot more convenient (and much more reliable) to use an
already existing code hosting solution such a GitHub. I have created a
small repo there housing my humble Emacs configuration(.emacs, some
custom stuff) and this way I can easily access it on all the computers
that I happen to be working on.

**Update**

At some point my custom configuration grew into what is known today as
the [Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-prelude).
