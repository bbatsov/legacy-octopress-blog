[CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) 0.9 is finally out and
it's our best release yet (believe it or not)! It took a lot
more time than I originally anticipated, but at least we managed to
ship in time for [EuroClojure](http://euroclojure.org)!

There are a ton of important changes and new features in 0.9 and now I'll go
quickly through some of them.

### Debugger

Believe it or not CIDER now has a debugger! This was like
the most requested feature ever, so I'm sure at least some of you are
excited. The debugger was developed by the awesome
[Artur Malabarba](http://endlessparentheses.com). He even wrote
[a post about it](http://endlessparentheses.com/cider-debug-a-visual-interactive-debugger-for-clojure.html)
and I guess you should read it.

### Dependency isolation

CIDER's dependencies will no longer affect your projects (read this as
_introduce dependency conflicts in them_). All the dependencies are
now isolated using source rewriting (simply put - they live in
different namespaces than the original libraries). This magic is done by
[mranderson](https://github.com/benedekfazekas/mranderson). Thanks to
[Benedek Fazekas](https://github.com/benedekfazekas) for creating this
small but super helpful tool!

### Rich code completion

Completion candidates are now annotated with information about the
namespace and the type of the thing being completed. It's pretty neat.

The screenshot above features
[company-mode](http://company-mode.github.io/). The annotations are
not supported in `auto-complete-mode` (that's a limitation of AC, not
a limitation of CIDER).

### Misc additions

Here's a short list of other important additions:

* Support for Piggieback 0.2
* New code formatting commands (based on [cljfmt](https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt))
* New EDN data formatting commands

## Changes

There were also a few important changes. Most notably we had to
[kill source-tracking code evaluation](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1088),
as it wasn't playing nice with ClojureScript. This was also a hacky
solution and I still hope than one day this will be properly supported
in nREPL itself. In simple terms - var definitions evaluated by
themselves won't have any location metadata set for them, which will
make it impossible to go their definition.  You can also help out by
voicing your support for this
[nREPL ticket](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/NREPL-59)'s patch to
be merged.

You'll also notice that some commands that didn't prompt for
confirmation in the past do so now (e.g. `find-var`).  This was done mostly for
consistency with Emacs's own commands that do similar things. The
behavior is configurable via `cider-prompt-for-symbol`. If a ton of
people dislike the new defaults reverting them is on the table.

## All the Gory Details

There were truly a ton of changes and there's little point in me
repeating them here. If you want to know everything have a look at the
[release notes](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v0.9.0).

## The Road Ahead

Going forward our top priority will be merging some functionality from
[refactor-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl) and
[clj-refactor](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el) into
CIDER itself.  Think of things like `find-usages`,
`extract-definition`, etc. Refining the debugger will be another top
priority.

We'll also try to do some important internal changes:

- [reorganize the entire codebase in a more sensible manner](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1068)
- [rework nREPL response handling](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1099)
- [rework the REPL to use `comint-mode`](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/709)
- [improve quitting and restarting](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/732)

Depending of how well we progress on those tasks the next release will
be either 0.10 or 1.0. I won't make any commitments about its release
date (but judging from past it will likely be 3 to 6 months from now).

If you're wondering why things are moving more slowly lately, here's
the answer for you - I've been super busy since the beginning of the
year and haven't had much time for open-source projects. I'm hoping
this will change, but only time will tell.  I'm very happy that a lot
of people contributed to the development of CIDER 0.9. The project
definitely doesn't have a bus factor of one. :-)

Special thanks to [Michael Griffiths](https://github.com/cichli) who
did a ton of great work on this release. You rock!

**P.S.** Recently I talked on the
[Cognicast](http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast) about CIDER (in
general and 0.9 in particular). You might find
[this episode](http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast/080) interesting.

**P.P.S.** I'm rarely on IRC these days. `#cider` on
  [slack](https://clojurians.slack.com/) and our
  [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/clojure-emacs/cider) are the
  official CIDER chats as far as I'm concerned.
