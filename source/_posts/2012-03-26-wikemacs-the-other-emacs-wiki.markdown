There was a lot of heated arguing online after my post about the
problems of the EmacsWiki (The reddit thread had so many personal insults
against me that I decided I don't want to be a part of reddit
anymore. Apparently I was "batshit" and was causing problems in the
quiet rural Emacs community with my crazy ideas.).

I'd like to apologize to everyone insulted by my previous
posts. Contrary to popular belief I acknowledge EmacsWiki's
contribution to the Emacs community. Obviously many people are too
fond of its current format so I doubt that it will ever change
(considerably). I didn't mean to insult anyone, I just wanted to catch
your attention (which unfortunately requires harsher words from time to
time) and point it in the direction of the existing problems.

For the people that weren't happy with EmacsWiki - the ones that felt
my pain and were looking for a change I present
[WikEmacs](http://wikemacs.org) (pronounced wikimacs). It's a
MediaWiki powered Emacs wiki, that will try to bring to the community
cleaner, leaner and more up-to-date documentation.

There are only a few guidelines for the contributors there:

* articles should be geared only towards the current and future
  versions of Emacs (currently 23 and 24) for maintainability's sake.
* articles should not copy Emacs's or extension's official
  documentation - they should refer to it instead. An overview, some
  nice pointers, tips and links - that seems like a good article,
  doesn't it?
* comments and questions should go to an article's discussion page

File uploads are disabled on WikEmacs (but image file uploads will
probably be allowed soon) - it will never host Emacs extensions of any
sort.

There is a Google discussion group
[here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/wikemacs)
for more general questions regarding the wiki.

Our goal is not to copy over the 8500 articles available at
EmacsWiki. It's to provide a good road map for new users coming to
Emacs and enough helpful hints and tips for experienced users. Everyone
is welcome to join our efforts.

As far as short term goals go - have a look at the outlined structure
of the wiki (on its home page), pick a section that interests you and
create/extend/improve it. Our content is licensed with GNU's Free
Documentation License (which is compatible with Wikipedia's and
probably EmacsWiki's GPL2). Some nice blog articles about Emacs might
be converted to wiki articles with permission from their authors. You
might find [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try) useful to
automatically convert articles from other formats to MediaWiki markup
and [mediawiki.el](https://launchpad.net/mediawiki-el) to edit
articles on wiki from the comfort of your beloved editor.

Thanks to the people that brought us the original EmacsWiki. Thanks to
everyone who supported the idea for the new wiki. Thanks in advance to
all future contributors.

Some people will undoubtedly see the birth of WikEmacs as a separatist move to fraction
the Emacs community. To them I'd like to say that few things in life
are as productive as competition. Obviously a lot of people willing to
contribute to a new wiki are unwilling to do so for EmacsWiki and vice
versa. This is not a contest and there will be no winner. I wish the
best of luck to EmacsWiki and its supporters. What I wish for is to give
our community the best source of documentation available and the
option to choose.
